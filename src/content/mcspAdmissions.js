      "At Hack Reactor, I initiated the automation of the Military Career team's admissions process, a project born from the need to enhance operational efficiency. My role involved innovating on our digital assessment tool, securing stakeholder approval, and orchestrating the integration of multiple admission pathways.",

      description: `The Military Career program had a non-scalable admissions process. Current plans involved cannibalizing members from other teams plus hiring additional staff.<br/><br/>I had a track record of successfully optimizing admissions and pre-enrollment services. In the project charter, I proposed to build out automation that would 1) address their specific requirements 2) scale to meet needs with current staffing.`,

      description: `The solution started from reviewing their process. Their were several blockers. The points that couldn't scale were the manual scheduling process and communications, data handling and reporting, and 1 hour live interviews plus review.<br/><br/>To free up time, I introduced a new process using a scheduling app with use of an API to automate scheduling and scheduling communications, automate weekly and cycle reports from a central database, and adding their team to our assessment platform.

     After training, I lead the team through alpha and beta testing of the app. I measured the results against predetermined metrics for student success and operations efficiency. One important measurement regarded student success rates. I had documented increasing student fail or pass rates as a potential risk. <br/><br/>At the end of Alpha and Beta, I reported the results to our executive team. The results showed that we were in range of fail and success rates, and that the majority of students preferred the new processes.`,

      The project was a resounding success. I delivered expected savings of $150,000 in new staffing costs and saved hundreds of hours monthly of current staffing time, giving time back to other projects and needs.`,
